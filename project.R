#we can check the relationship of the data using summary command to explore the data further
summary(women)
# we can create a model that will use lm function to create a linear regression model of the data
linearregressionmodel<- lm(weight~ height, data = women)
# we can use summary command again, this will provide descriptive statistics about the lm model that we have generated
summary(linearregressionmodel)#this will show that if one unit changes in x(the weight), it causes a unit change in the expected value of y(height)
#if we write equetion in general model( y=a+bx), this means that our prediction equetion for the linearregressionmodel is( linearregressionmodel= -87.52+(3.45*height))

#We can identify the relationship between height and weight, by calculating the correlation.to do so we can use pearson's correlation coefficent, which is a measur of the linear correlation between two variables x and y. it produces a result in the form of a value between +1 and -A inclusive, where 1 is a total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and -1 show a perfect negative correlatioin.This value is known as pearson,s R
# we use cor function to compute pearson's correlation coefficient.
rmodel<-cor(women$weight,women$height)
#we can see the result of the model by using the following 
rmodel^2
#We can find out more information by using the plot command , which will provide us with four visualization in R
